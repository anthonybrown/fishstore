#fishstore

A singlepage application using React.js, react-router, pushstate, localstorage. OAuth and
social media and Firebase to hold data.

The app will load a new store for every new user, if you authorize a store, you will
become the store's "owner" (it will be saved in a firebase database) and save any changes
made to that store.
I didn't bother to get the Facebook OAuth configured correctly but I'll come back to that.
